## Introduction

Maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for health and wellness. This project aims to facilitate dietary tracking by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify food items from images and estimate their calorie content. By leveraging image recognition and calorie estimation, users can easily monitor their food intake.

## Features

- **Food Image Recognition**: Identifies various food items from images with high accuracy.
- **Calorie Estimation**: Estimates the calorie content of the identified food items.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for uploading images and receiving instant feedback.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on a diverse dataset of food images to ensure robust performance.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a combination of publicly available food image datasets, including:

- [Food-101 Dataset](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/)
- [UECFOOD-256 Dataset](http://foodcam.mobi/dataset256_2.html)

These datasets provide a wide variety of food images labeled with corresponding categories and nutritional information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-recognition-calorie-estimation.git
   cd food-recognition-calorie-estimation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To use the model for food recognition and calorie estimation, follow these steps:

2. Ensure your dataset is organized in the specified format (e.g., separate folders for each food category).

3. Run the script to load the model and start the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the application in your web browser and upload a food image to receive predictions.

## Model Training

To train the model from scratch or fine-tune it on a new dataset:

1. Prepare the dataset:

   ```bash
   python prepare_dataset.py --data_dir path/to/dataset
   ```

2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --data_dir path/to/dataset
   ```

3. Save the trained model:

   ```bash
   python save_model.py --output_dir path/to/save/model
   ```

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing food items and provides reliable calorie estimates. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the `results` directory.
